Refactoring Activity
Paul ReFalo 11/19/17

	For this activity I choose chapter 7's assignment for the ISS viewing times.  I noticed
when completed it the first time that I was reusing code to in two places to check if the
API succeeded or failed.  I refactored this code to using one method instead of repeat the 
code in two places.
	I also choose to refactor the way I was checking for the API success/failure.  What I
had originally wrote called the API with get and then I checked to see if I get the results
in text form from that response.  If so, this was judged a successful API call.  To refactor 
this, I used the demonstration code the instructor gave which makes use of the status_code
rather than checking for response.text.  This seems much cleaner than the way I had 
originally done it.  Below you will see the refactored code followed by the orginal code.  
Original code starts on ~ line 108.
